# pythonprojects
This repository is to add multiple python projects

1) Fake currency detection using Logistic Regression algorithm
    - where we fit the data in Logistic Regression model to train the model, as well as we used StandardScalar from sklearn to standardise the data and to extract, scale and integrate into our pre-trained model
    - dependencies: python 3.9, numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit.
