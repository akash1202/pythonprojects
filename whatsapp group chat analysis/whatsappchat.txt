08/05/18, 1:12 pm - +49 173 4776482: What do you mean with dashboard design? You have the material design and can build your own needs like a login page and a dashboard with graphs
08/05/18, 1:13 pm - +91 94525 81860: ok ....design part in flutter really confuses me a lot
08/05/18, 1:18 pm - +49 173 4776482: Best is to use the flutter sample app to lern a little. There are all Material Widget samples https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.flutter.gallery

DropdownButton<int>( items: locations.map((String val) { return new DropdownMenuItem<String>( value: val, child: new Text(val), ); }).toList(), hint: Text("Please choose a location"), onChanged: (newVal) { _selectedLocation = newVal; this.setState(() {}); });
This is the Code for the drowdown Button and you can fill it with json with the example video i posted bevore. Than you can fill the onchange function with a Textview Change with the other informations of the json object. I you need help text me directly so we dont spam here 😬

15/05/18, 10:14 am - Karan gajjar: Such members leaving instantly no one can take care of this . Let's wait for WhatsApp's new features which includes permission for sending any posts
15/05/18, 10:14 am - +91 97170 52474: Yes agreed .. There should be at least a couple of more admins because you can't restrict addition of people coz you never know what's their intentions but it can be controlled
15/05/18, 10:15 am - +55 11 98123-7131: close the link...
15/05/18, 10:23 am - +49 173 4776482: the only thing we can do is to close the inv link and invite people by number if they want to join to prevent spam

15/05/18, 10:33 am - +46 76 778 44 73: If we will have couple more admins then they can delete spam posts and block the user
15/05/18, 10:36 am - +49 173 4776482: Admins can do nothing because the spambots are joining posting and leaving instantly. Admins can't delete posts in whatsapp as far as I know
15/05/18, 10:38 am - +55 11 98123-7131: so I think it's better to remove inv link and control who can or not join the group
15/05/18, 11:02 am - You're now an admin
15/05/18, 11:01 am - Karan gajjar: There are more admissions now.
And closing invite link would be troublesome for adding new members. The only solution is wait for new WhatsApp update that will give more benefits to admins to control group

19/05/18, 12:57 am - +91 89394 45650: navigate to drawable folder in Android section of your flutter app, there you will find launcher xml,there uncomment the item section and give your command. This can be performed for Splash Screen. For normal image, you have to use padding i guess

19/05/18, 5:31 am - +254 725 095439: Has anyone found a solution to the lag in flutter
19/05/18, 5:31 am - +254 725 095439: I've noticed a lag when switching between form elements i.e. two textfields
19/05/18, 5:32 am - +91 89394 45650: Nope..I haven't face this lagging issue.I have created a Login form and it works fine
19/05/18, 5:32 am - +91 89394 45650: Just Someties the Login button responds a little bit late
19/05/18, 5:33 am - +254 725 095439: This is normal in flutter
19/05/18, 5:33 am - +254 725 095439: I expect a fast transition as we have in native android development with xml but its not the case
19/05/18, 5:33 am - +91 89394 45650: Ok Cool...then i would not take a headache pill
19/05/18, 5:34 am - +91 89394 45650: maybe device maybe responding late
19/05/18, 5:35 am - +254 725 095439: 🤔 Wouldn't this be the same in other android development paradigms ?
19/05/18, 5:36 am - +91 89394 45650: Maybe is the best answer i can give...!! Did you tried debugging, maybe you can find something there..!!
19/05/18, 5:36 am - +91 89394 45650: because this RenderFlex is an issue
19/05/18, 5:37 am - +91 89394 45650: Sometimes it shows overflowed by xxx pixels
19/05/18, 5:37 am - +91 89394 45650: sometimes not
19/05/18, 5:37 am - +91 89394 45650: in the same form which i told you is working fine
19/05/18, 5:39 am - +254 725 095439: Alright.
19/05/18, 5:39 am - +254 725 095439: I'm on github and the issue is already there
19/05/18, 5:39 am - +254 725 095439: No fix for now
19/05/18, 5:42 am - +91 89394 45650: ok cool
19/05/18, 6:13 am - +254 725 095439: Running the app in release mode takes away the lag.

The first Tab is a StatefulWidget with a video playing. The Problem is, when i switch to another tab, the video continues. If I switch back to the First Fragment, the video plays twice.
How can i destroy the old view on switch and eventually save the state and load it later again?

05/06/18, 11:56 am - +55 31 9286-4690: But it is good to know that CDG could also be a possibility too.
05/06/18, 11:56 am - +91 90339 76465: CDG?

21/06/18, 3:40 am - +91 73525 70448: I think you are creating new row by getRow and itemCount is global variable.

You need to keep all the row in a List array with separate itemCount. So that you can increase separate itemcount

I hope someone can help me here... lol...

I'm building a test application with facebook login... it's working fine and you can check how i'm getting facebook user's data:


final FacebookLoginResult result =
        await facebookSignIn.logInWithReadPermissions(['email']);
    var accessToken = result.accessToken;
    var graphResponse = await http.get(
            'https://graph.facebook.com/v2.12/me?fields=picture,name,email&access_token=${accessToken.token}');
    var profile = JSON.decode(graphResponse.body);


When I click facebook login button, i've got a new screen with a drawer, and this drawer has a UserAccountsDraweHeader...

I've got the accountName and accountEmail from var profile, and this has a JSON data, but, if you check the GRAPH URL, i'm getting a picture too, so now, I need to get this picture URL to do a CircleAvatar, but i have no idea how to do this from a JSON data...

Here is the code i'm using to build this drawer:


@override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      drawer: Drawer(
        child: ListView(
          children: <Widget>[
            UserAccountsDrawerHeader(
              accountName: Text('${widget.value['name']}'),
              accountEmail: Text('${widget.value['email']}'),
              // currentAccountPicture: CircleAvatar(
              //   backgroundImage: ,
              // ),
            ),
            ListTile(
              title: Text('Incluir'),
              trailing: Icon(Icons.add),
              onTap: (){},
            ),
            ListTile(
              title: Text('Listar'),
              trailing: Icon(Icons.list),
              onTap: (){},
            ),
            ListTile(
              title: Text('Sair'),
              trailing: Icon(Icons.exit_to_app),
              onTap: (){},
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('App Renda Fixa'),
        backgroundColor: Color(0xFF1f8eeb),
        
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Hello Word'),

14/07/18, 2:45 pm - +92 334 1524004: Bro intellij is something like android studio and vs code just the editor like atom and  npp?
14/07/18, 2:45 pm - +55 11 98123-7131: I think is the same, because VS code, android studio and intelli J use the same android SDK
14/07/18, 2:47 pm - +91 98685 96948: i m asking coz m using both and sometimes both of them install previous build instead of fresh ...now i dont know whether its because of hot reloading(flutter bug) or studio bug .
14/07/18, 2:54 pm - +55 11 98123-7131: well... I like VS code and I'm using it... sometimes I use intelli J only to see the widget trees... but I think there isnt a lot performance difference between intelliJ, VS code and Android Studio... I know VS code use a few more memory than IntelliJ and Android Studio, but i'm not sure if this can cause a perfomance problem...

17/07/18, 10:09 am - +55 11 95900-9515: Hey guys. A little noob question here. When changing from an activity with a drawer, do i have to write all the drawer code into the other activity?
17/07/18, 10:16 am - +91 98685 96948: I haven't tried this way...maybe u cn try same appbar on all activity...just a random guess
17/07/18, 10:20 am - +55 11 95900-9515: yeah the thing is that i'm doing a test app for a startup and they want a drawer to be made. I was starting to do the test app and tought about this. There will be 3 screens. Not a big deal to copy/paste the drawer code but i want to know if there's a cleaner way to do this....
17/07/18, 11:09 am - +91 98685 96948: Why don't u use fragments?

17/08/18, 12:36 am - +91 72769 59699: Why this error is coming

This is my first Flutter App 

I'm noob in flutter
17/08/18, 1:31 am - +55 31 8440-1413: Well, first your app is called FirstApp, not MyApp
17/08/18, 1:35 am - +91 72769 59699: OK 
Hm right 
Changed to FirstApp
17/08/18, 5:11 am - +91 73525 70448: Delete that test file
This is not useful when you modify the first code.

First code means the code which comes with flutter default project.
17/08/18, 5:14 am - +91 72769 59699: OK thank you

17/08/18, 1:25 pm - +91 73525 70448: I'll make
17/08/18, 1:25 pm - +91 73525 70448: By the way you can look at official Gallery app.
17/08/18, 1:25 pm - +91 73525 70448: Actually I laptop is broken that's why I'm not able to help
17/08/18, 1:26 pm - +55 11 98123-7131: ok... no problem... I'll check the gallery
17/08/18, 1:41 pm - +55 31 8440-1413: I implemented this using the package flutter_swiper, check if it solves your problem and just use it inside a vertical scrollView
17/08/18, 1:42 pm - +55 31 8440-1413: @5511981237131 I think this will work for you
17/08/18, 1:43 pm - +55 11 98123-7131: nice @553184401413... I'll check too
17/08/18, 2:02 pm - +91 87369 77760: Any readymade cart template repo?
17/08/18, 3:11 pm - +55 31 8440-1413: The implementation in the bloc_pattern cart example is probably one of the best
17/08/18, 3:11 pm - +55 31 8440-1413: it is on https://github.com/filiph/state_experiments/tree/master/shared/
17/08/18, 3:12 pm - +55 31 8440-1413: there is many templates there for cart implementations in different architectures types, redux, bloc, scoped
17/08/18, 4:01 pm - +91 87369 77760: Anyone else with a e-commerce cart only template.

02/05/19, 2:45 am - +91 99586 62272: hi..
I want a suggestion from all of you ; i am implementing a quiz module where all questions(10) are showing on mobile screen using RecyclerView one by one that are get once from apis
so my question is, what is the best way to submit answer to server in the form of array at once or it is like submit answer one by one to server.
Please help me out
02/05/19, 2:57 am - +91 98920 21890: Are users allowed to go back to previous questions to change option?
How fast is the server, after final submission, user will have to wait too much?
02/05/19, 3:04 am - +91 99586 62272: No user only submit once  can't go back
02/05/19, 3:04 am - +91 98920 21890: Then one by one
02/05/19, 3:05 am - +91 98920 21890: Async
02/05/19, 6:41 am - +91 88835 02600: I think it will not be optimized when the server script is hosted in shared hosting or cheap hosting.
It's better to create list and add the users answers and then convert it to Json after 10 questions over and then send to server as a string in parameters or body and then decode the string to Json and process the value..
02/05/19, 6:43 am - +91 99586 62272: ok thankss
02/05/19, 6:44 am - +91 96668 44498: Anybody design quiz app in flutter need to fetch data from json

11/05/19, 5:43 am - Aaaaaaa: . If you were asked to develop an app that tracks how long a person is sleeping (including start time and end time) just using a smart phone app and no other external hardware, how would you go about doing it? Of course, there is no 100% accurate way to doing it, but would like to understand your logic.
    - Keep it simple and not overly complicated
    - Of course, simple does not mean that the results can be inaccurate
    - The app should achieve the functionality even if the app is not running in foreground
    - The app should also work for most versions of OS and hardware (different makes and models)
    - No user input should be assumed eg, user is not going to say when he is sleeping or waking up or alarms or reminders
    - The user should be able to install and forget. The app should quietly do its job in the background
    - The logic should not be dependent on Apple Health  Google Health APIs
11/05/19, 5:44 am - Aaaaaaa: Better
11/05/19, 5:44 am - Aaaaaaa: How I make it help me

11/05/19, 6:14 am - +91 89738 74573: Most of the times users charged their smartphones while they are going to sleep. So, we can get the charging time .

11/05/19, 6:35 am - +91 72769 59699: As implementing this solution there are chances for inaccurate results
Suppose if person have already charged phone then?

27/05/19, 6:46 am - +91 98920 21890: Work from inside out.
You have a key and a value
Value is array
Key is string
Each element is a map.

List<Map<String,List<>>
27/05/19, 6:46 am - +91 98920 21890: *List<>>>

05/06/19, 8:05 am - +92 311 1035294: I used dio library to post file to a server and it is working fine, now i want to post multiple images to server that user selects from gallery, following is the code from documentation of dio library for uploading multiple files 
 
FormData formData = new FormData.from({
    "name": "wendux",
    "age": 25,
    "file1": new UploadFileInfo(new File("./upload.txt"), "upload1.txt"),
    // upload with bytes (List<int>)
    "file2": new UploadFileInfo.fromBytes(
        utf8.encode("hello world"), "word.txt"),
    // Pass multiple files within an Array
    "files": [
      new UploadFileInfo(new File("./example/upload.txt"), "upload.txt"),
      new UploadFileInfo(new File("./example/upload.txt"), "upload.txt")
    ]
});
my question is that how can i implement this in my code for images?? because i don't know that how many images are selected by user.

19/06/19, 3:53 am - +91 98920 21890: Listview Builder.
Each atm is a widget.
Icon with text at right,
At left, a column,
ICICI
Atm
Distance (pass to function which returns widget)
19/06/19, 3:54 am - +91 98920 21890: I think if index == len(ATMs), return the row at the bottom.
19/06/19, 4:08 am - +91 95353 40444: I want a condition that only display near by ATMs @919892021890

19/06/19, 4:09 am - +91 95353 40444: If I pass keyboard as ATM I need all near by ATMs
19/06/19, 4:09 am - +91 95353 40444: Can I please share that condition
19/06/19, 4:10 am - +91 98920 21890: Or, sort the results by a key, which is distance
19/06/19, 4:10 am - +91 98920 21890: What is the result format?

12/08/19, 10:00 am - +267 74 401 600: hi guys .. i have 2 questions
*1)*  can ads work on offline flutter app

*2)*  where is best place to store questions and answers for quiz app 
(some questions have image)
12/08/19, 10:02 am - +91 98920 21890: My best bet will be to use sqlite
12/08/19, 10:03 am - +91 98920 21890: Store text data as it is and path to images for questions with images
12/08/19, 10:03 am - +267 74 401 600: on app .. or API ?
12/08/19, 10:04 am - +91 98920 21890: On app
12/08/19, 10:04 am - +91 98920 21890: Since you are talking about offline so you can't contact API when offline
12/08/19, 10:05 am - +91 98920 21890: *sqflite
12/08/19, 10:05 am - +91 96668 44498: 1. Yes .. Add will work on flutter
2. You can store as Json and parse it.. Or you can use database
12/08/19, 10:05 am - +91 98920 21890: Ads work offline?
Which ad service?
Google admob doesn't with offline
12/08/19, 10:06 am - +267 74 401 600: wont that make the app size big
12/08/19, 10:06 am - +91 98920 21890: Depends on how many images.
You can use webp images for short size
12/08/19, 10:07 am - +91 96668 44498: Ads won't work in offline... You can use dummy ads to text functionality
12/08/19, 10:07 am - +91 98920 21890: But if you want users to have the option to use app without internet, you need to store on device
12/08/19, 10:07 am - +91 88835 02600: Yes ads can be integrated but ads show only when user have connected to internet.

Many users nowadays always connect to internet.
12/08/19, 10:08 am - +91 98920 21890: That's true
12/08/19, 10:08 am - +267 74 401 600: api can be contacted on first install ..
12/08/19, 10:09 am - +91 98920 21890: Idea:
Store in sqflite (only textual data)
And on server (AWS EC2) // serverless (AWS lambda) questions with images.

If user connected,
Contact API and also use local questions

Else only local questions
12/08/19, 10:10 am - +91 98920 21890: You can also update local copy periodically from API
12/08/19, 10:11 am - +91 98920 21890: Or firebase
12/08/19, 10:11 am - +91 98920 21890: Or digital ocean
Or heroku
15/08/19, 1:06 pm - +91 98920 21890: Has anyone used mongodb mobile for LOCAL db on Flutter?
15/08/19, 1:06 pm - +91 89738 74573: Yes
15/08/19, 1:07 pm - +91 98920 21890: Can you send resources and/or suggest the websites on which to depend
15/08/19, 1:07 pm - +91 98920 21890: PS: I don't want to connect to a cloud db.
I want db on device
15/08/19, 1:07 pm - +91 89738 74573: What you want?
15/08/19, 1:09 pm - +91 98920 21890: Storing, retrieving, setting up.
The whole suite.

I need to store some part of data currently in cloud db made in python on local device (instead of storing in shared prefs)
15/08/19, 1:09 pm - +91 98920 21890: Or converting to sqflite

12/09/19, 11:58 am - +91 98920 21890: I don't think it is possible.
Unless you do a hack like, create a widget having top as alert, middle transparent and end duplicate of bottom bar and place it instead of default alert
12/09/19, 11:59 am - +91 95353 40444: Full day I am scratching  my head for this@Susmit
12/09/19, 12:00 pm - +91 98920 21890: Can only provide ideas.
Implementation is upto you
12/09/19, 12:00 pm - +91 95353 40444: Yes.  Even I am not asking  implementation
12/09/19, 12:00 pm - +91 95353 40444: Just idea too
12/09/19, 12:00 pm - +91 98920 21890: Basically you need a widget in which you need to have alert as a child, transparent, and bottom bar as childs.
12/09/19, 12:01 pm - +91 98920 21890: Instead of that I would suggest you top snackbar for notification

12/09/19, 12:02 pm - +91 95353 40444: I can't  use snackbar bcoz I have specific alert design
12/09/19, 12:03 pm - +91 95353 40444: No alert should  be displayed  in  body only
12/09/19, 12:03 pm - +91 98920 21890: Then this may be the only option.

25/09/19, 2:29 am - +234 816 347 1885: I don't know about Flutter but if you were using a RecyclerView in Kotlin/Java there's a method to get the completely Visible view from the RecyclerView. 

That way you can get it/their index and set them as _seen_.

I think there should be a Flutter alternative.

2) setState in child class (to show that it is selected, that blue overlay over the card)

Any one implemented the Microsoft login in flutter?
08/01/20, 2:30 pm - +1 (480) 740-2683: Does Flutter allow support for Android/iOS device features like accessing the camera, calendar, or other hardware/internal components of the device?
08/01/20, 2:55 pm - +55 11 98975-6633: Yeap
08/01/20, 2:56 pm - +55 11 98975-6633: If it doesn't have a plug-in for it available you could write yours using method channels
08/01/20, 3:08 pm - +1 (480) 740-2683: Oh ok
08/01/20, 3:09 pm - +1 (480) 740-2683: So it can access them the same way a native Android application can?
08/01/20, 3:09 pm - +55 11 98975-6633: Yeap
08/01/20, 3:09 pm - +1 (480) 740-2683: Ok
08/01/20, 3:09 pm - +1 (480) 740-2683: What about React Native?

08/01/20, 3:11 pm - +55 11 98975-6633: I'm not to familiar with react native but if I'm not mistaken it's possible to but it's away more limited than flutter

09/01/20, 2:03 pm - +91 78383 07838: if you are building 2d game app flutter may have upper hand other wise it's more or less same
09/01/20, 2:03 pm - +91 78383 07838: also big benefit of learning react native is react
09/01/20, 2:04 pm - +91 78383 07838: if you know text you can do mobile as well as web front end
09/01/20, 2:04 pm - +91 78383 07838: which means more job

Generate random number.
Save in db.
Use some sms sender service.
One more post api which will carry otp entered by user in client
Verify in db
Return

21/01/20, 10:42 am - +91 98920 21890: Suggestion: use a trigger to send sms on otp added in db instead of sending sms from generateOtp() to separate the two Parts

So if you change the sms sender service, just need to touch the onTrigger helpful in case where multiple functions may put otp in db

just add *await* before the function..

08/02/20, 7:53 am - +971 55 662 0140: Goto Android>Gradle.properties
08/02/20, 7:55 am - +971 55 662 0140: Then change the version to the lastest or as showed in the image 5.1.1
08/02/20, 7:55 am - +91 99127 36754: <Media omitted>
08/02/20, 7:55 am - +91 99127 36754: There is nothing like version and all..
08/02/20, 7:56 am - +971 55 662 0140: Sorry build.gradle
08/02/20, 7:56 am - +971 55 662 0140: It's in that
08/02/20, 7:56 am - +91 99127 36754: I did that earlier.. didn't work..
08/02/20, 7:57 am - +971 55 662 0140: Open it in android
08/02/20, 7:57 am - +971 55 662 0140: Studio
08/02/20, 7:58 am - +91 99127 36754: Moreover..as it shows in the image..it says..the current version is 4.10.2..whereas her in my code(Android->build.gradle) it shows the current is 3.5.3..

Mismatch..so..I guess..the error is pointing to some other location..
08/02/20, 8:00 am - +971 55 662 0140: Go-to android
08/02/20, 8:00 am - +971 55 662 0140: Then there would be a .Gradle folder
08/02/20, 8:00 am - +91 99127 36754: Yes..there is..
08/02/20, 8:00 am - +971 55 662 0140: Sorry Gradle / wrapper
08/02/20, 8:01 am - +91 99127 36754: Then.. gradle.properties..!
08/02/20, 8:01 am - +91 99127 36754: Even that didn't work..

08/02/20, 8:01 am - +971 55 662 0140: Like this

08/02/20, 8:02 am - +91 99127 36754: .
08/02/20, 8:02 am - +91 99127 36754: ☹
08/02/20, 8:02 am - +971 55 662 0140: Can I see that file

08/02/20, 8:04 am - +91 99127 36754: And.. again..

It doesn't contain any number like *4.10.2*..as it shows in the error..
08/02/20, 8:04 am - +971 55 662 0140: Try flutter clean
08/02/20, 8:05 am - +91 99127 36754: Didn't work..
08/02/20, 8:05 am - +971 55 662 0140: Did you tried to migrate to AndroidX
08/02/20, 8:06 am - +91 99127 36754: Actually..I have found that *4.10.2* in a file..

In the same gradle-wrapper.properties file..
08/02/20, 8:06 am - +91 99127 36754: But here is the twist..
08/02/20, 8:06 am - +91 99127 36754: It's not the one that is in my project..
08/02/20, 8:06 am - +971 55 662 0140: What
08/02/20, 8:06 am - +971 55 662 0140: Oh

08/02/20, 8:07 am - +971 55 662 0140: Did fixed the problem?
08/02/20, 8:07 am - +91 98920 21890: So maybe update the dependency of firebase

O sistema usa sua própria moeda, a Q. Para incentivar as pessoas a começarem a usar o sistema uma vez que estiver pronto, eles estão alocando Qs gratuitamente para pessoas que se cadastrarem agora (a quantidade diminui à medida que mais pessoas se cadastram, portanto, é melhor se cadastrar cedo). O cadastro é gratuito e eles só pedem nome e e-mail. Não há nada a perder, mas, se este sistema se tornar um líder mundial como método de pagamento, suas Qs poderão valer muito. Se você deixou de comprar bitcoin sete anos atrás, não vai querer perder esta oportunidade.

Aqui está o meu link de convite: https://initiativeq.com/invite/S8uiaBg67 

Este link deixará de funcionar quando meus convites acabarem. Avise-me depois que você se cadastrar, porque eu preciso verificar seu cadastro através da minha conta.

24/04/20, 1:14 pm - +91 88835 02600: Literally I was facing the similar kind of  issue .
Where I have generated a sha key which was for debug  build.
While I was trying to generate sha for release build I get the same sha 1 key as like debug build.
It was weird for me.
Finally I solved it.

I will try to  give the solution for windows.
First go to bin folder in java or if have in't installed go to jre bin in Android folder .
The open command prompt from there .

https://stackoverflow.com/a/15727931/9248098

Follow this answer.

Don't know why it's not even generating in singing report tab.

If need for release, generate a signed apk as you do normally.

The follow the answer where you need to put the path for the jks file.
It will ask for password.
Then you will get sha-1 key for your version.

26/04/20, 6:51 am - +91 98920 21890: Firestore:

I have a field visits : int
I want to get documents by descending order of visits, so I used order By in query.

I also want to paginate (fetch n number of documents at a time, eg. 5 documents)

The problem is that some documents can have same value in the visits column.

So after order by visits desc, it will look like

Document ID,  Visits
A      ,     5
B     ,      4
C     ,      4
D     ,      3
E     ,       2

The document IDs are autogenerated.

To fix this problem, I used last_visits (visits value in last fetched doc) and last_doc_id 
in start after.

My motive is that, after sorting by visits, if 2 or more docs have same value, it should order by document Id

This is not working, it is giving me a link to create a composite index , and when I go to that link, it says single field index is sufficient, which is already there.

Please help

27/04/20, 12:33 am - +91 98920 21890: Firestore:

I have a field visits : int
I want to get documents by descending order of visits, so I used order By in query.

I also want to paginate (fetch n number of documents at a time, eg. 5 documents)

The problem is that some documents can have same value in the visits column.

So after order by visits desc, it will look like

Document ID,  Visits
A      ,     5
B     ,      4
C     ,      4
D     ,      3
E     ,       2

The document IDs are autogenerated.

To fix this problem, I used last_visits (visits value in last fetched doc) and last_doc_id 
in start after.

My motive is that, after sorting by visits, if 2 or more docs have same value, it should order by document Id

This is not working, it is giving me a link to create a composite index , and when I go to that link, it says single field index is sufficient, which is already there.

Please help

I am facing trouble with Mapbox. the map showed gray and error says: " Could not instantiate image codec". I generate the new taken key, Uri template, and also the id for the street view and included them in the code but it keeps show grey area and also says the same error. Pleas
04/05/20, 11:05 pm - +91 90410 06810: Ok send me code i will check
04/05/20, 11:29 pm - +234 816 347 1885: Okay, the issue was because I was using Expanded widget improperly.

But I'm not sure why it is improper.

My ListView throw an exception when I don't wrap them in a SizedBox (with fixed height) or Expanded widget.

And when I wrap it with Expanded, it shows that Grey background in release.
04/05/20, 11:36 pm - +91 90410 06810: Give height: mediaquery.size.height
05/05/20, 12:57 am - +234 816 347 1885: To?
05/05/20, 12:58 am - +91 90410 06810: Sizedbox

05/05/20, 1:09 am - +91 90410 06810: Then give height to container or sizedbox
05/05/20, 1:14 am - +234 816 347 1885: The content of the ListView is not definite.
 If I give it a fixed height the content might cut off before it gets to the bottom of some screens.

The only way to give it a fixed height might be to calculate the height of the widgets above it and subtract it from the device height, but I don't want to do that 😩
05/05/20, 1:20 am - +91 90410 06810: Oh
05/05/20, 1:23 am - +91 99127 36754: You can use expanded..I guess..not sure though..

To solve this problem I came up with a solution as my contribution in the fight against Covid-19.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fieapps.stayhomeindia

In this app you will see a list of shops within your city registered with us. You can either order by adding items from app or uploading a hand written list of items. Your order will be delivered by the shop staff in least possible time.
